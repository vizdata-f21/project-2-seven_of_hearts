DukeHub 3.0
================

## Introduction

DukeHub is the academic portal used by Duke students, faculty, and
advisers to register for courses, make tuition payments, and view
transcripts. Each semester, students spend much time crafting their
schedules to optimize campus experience. The current DukeHub 2.0 has a
“simple search” function to filter courses by term and subject area and
an “advanced class search” to filter by course attributes, meeting
times, instructor name, location, or the number of units. Although
DukeHub 2.0, launched in 2020, has improved user experience and added
more features compared to the previous version, our team would like to
add several features that make the course selection process more
convenient. For example, we will give the users the opportunity to
visualize the distance between the classes they choose to avoid
unnecessary travel in between classes. We will also make recommendations
on the good study spots based on the schedules users create.
