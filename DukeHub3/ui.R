to register for courses, make tuition payments, and view transcripts. Each
semester, students spend much time crafting their schedules to optimize campus
experience. The current DukeHub 2.0 has a “simple search” function to filter
courses by term and subject area and an “advanced class search” to filter by
course attributes, meeting times, instructor name, location, or the number of
units. Although DukeHub 2.0, launched in 2020, has improved user experience and
added more features compared to the previous version, our team would like to add
several features that make the course selection process more convenient. Our
DukeHub 3.0 is an R Shiny app that allows students to build their academic
schedule from 2408 courses/sections and provides additional insights to their
schedule through various visualizations. Once a student inputs their schedule,
the app will provide different visualizations such as the enrollment caps,
diversity of the subject areas they study, and the expected traveling during a
day based on the classes student select."),

report invalid."),

  Monday to Friday, even if there is no class on a certain day and from

  from the schedule, the smallest width rectangle is the discussion for Hindi.
  This qualitatively confirms which class is shorter in time and helps
  the reader have a more accurate understanding of their courses without
  needing to refer to the reference course list below. To seperate the days,
  we added vertical lines. Also, each course is colored differenly. Even though
  both hindi components are in the same department and course number, they
  are still seperate course components and we wanted to reflect that. This
  comes in very handy when there is a special topics class like AAAS 190S,
