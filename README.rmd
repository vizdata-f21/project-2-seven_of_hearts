## Introduction

DukeHub is the academic portal used by Duke students, faculty, and advisers to register for courses, make tuition payments, and view transcripts. Each semester, students spend much time crafting their schedules to optimize campus experience. The current DukeHub 2.0 has a “simple search” function to filter courses by term and subject area and an “advanced class search” to filter by course attributes, meeting times, instructor name, location, or the number of units. Although DukeHub 2.0, launched in 2020, has improved user experience and added more features compared to the previous version, our team would like to add several features that make the course selection process more convenient. Our DukeHub 3.0 is an R Shiny app that allows students to build their academic schedule from 2408 courses/sections and provides additional insights to their schedule through various visualizations. Once a student inputs their schedule, the app will provide different visualizations such as the distance between the classes they choose to avoid unnecessary travel in between classes. We will also make recommendations on the good study spots based on the schedules users create.

## Interactive functions
We designed 5 tabs for students to explore the details of their course schedules.

### Schedule builder
Students can choose courses based on the specific subjects they would like to take. Like the DukeHub 2.0, students can validate their schedule to avoid time conflicts and overload limits, drop classes back to the shopping cart, and clear all selections. One improvement from DukeHub 2.0 is that more information about classes is available on the same page. 

Take an example of a student who wants to choose African American Studies. In DukeHub 2.0, the dropdown list only contains the course catalog numbers and descriptions.

### Weekly calendar
The courses selected in the previous step will show up in a daily calendar format, colored by their patterns (WF, TTh, MWF, etc).

### Class information
The enrollment caps of the student’s classes are represented in a bar chart colored by subject areas. General areas include "Arts & Humanities", "Natural Sciences", "Social Sciences", "Engineering",  "Language",  "Physical Education", and "Writing" according to Duke academic curriculum. Students will be able to make choices conveniently after visualizing the size of other classes. Subject areas are shown in a pie chart to give the student an idea of how diverse their classes are that semester.
