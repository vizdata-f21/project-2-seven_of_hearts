## Introduction

DukeHub is the academic portal used by Duke students, faculty, and advisers to register for courses, make tuition payments, and view transcripts. Each semester, students spend much time crafting their schedules to optimize campus experience. The current DukeHub 2.0 has a “simple search” function to filter courses by term and subject area and an “advanced class search” to filter by course attributes, meeting times, instructor name, location, or the number of units. Although DukeHub 2.0, launched in 2020, has improved user experience and added more features compared to the previous version, our team would like to add several features that make the course selection process more convenient. For example, we will give the users the opportunity to visualize the distance between the classes they choose to avoid unnecessary travel in between classes. We will also make recommendations on the good study spots based on the schedules users create.
