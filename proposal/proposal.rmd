### High Level Overview 

Create DukeHub 3.0, an R Shiny app that allows students to build their academic schedule and
provides additional insights to their schedule through data visualization.

### Project Description, Goals, & Motivation

Dukehub is an academic portal used by students, faculty, and advisers to view courses,
make tuition payments, and view transcripts. Each semester students spend countless 
crafting their schedules and back-up schedules. Students can find classes using a 
“simple search” by term and subject area. Students can also find classes using an 
“advanced class search” inputting the course attributes, meeting times, instructor
name, location, or the number of units. Duke launched DukeHub 2.0 in 2020 to 
improve user experience and add more features. DukeHub 2.0 is very useful, but our 
team wishes it would provide more information beyond schedule building. Our team’s 
goal is to create an improved DukeHub using a shiny app which allows students to 
select courses for their schedule and provides additional information about their 
schedule based on their selection. This will include information regarding 
estimated commute times, distance traveled, and recommendations for 
studying and relaxing based on their selection. There are 5 tabs in our R shiny app 
with different functionalities: 

- **Schedule Builder**: Allows students to add classes to their schedule by 
Subject Area or Course Name. Students can also customize their lab or discussion 
choices.
	
- **Weekly Calendar** Course schedule in a calendar based on student selection. If 
there is overlapping class times, a notification will pop up that there is 
an error with adding classes due to overlap. 

- **Class Info**: A sorted bar chart of the number of people in different courses 
selected by users and types of courses (by Subject Area) in different colors. 
  
- **Distance** : Geo-spatial visualization showing the distance traveled 
during a specific day or week; and commute times between buildings.  
	
- **Recommendations**: Based on input class schedule, the app will provide 
recommendations on where and when a student should study based on the locations
of their current and next class and what days they are most available to get meals
with friends.

To complete our project, we will be using a course catalog data set 
that we requested from the Duke University Registrar's Office (thank you Dr. 
Blalark). This data set contains 2,408 observations of 13 variables. Each observation
in the dataset represents a course which is offered to undergraduates during the 
Spring 2022 term. There are 13 variables in the dataset: `class_identifier`, 
`Subject`, `catalog_number`, `Descr`, `Section`, `enroll_cap`, `days`, `mtg_start`, 
`mtg_end`, `Mode`, `location`, `career`,  `term`. We cleaned some of the variable
names to make them more straighforward, for example, `Descr` is renamed to `location`,
`Pat` is renamed to `days`, etc. Additionally, we filtered coures which 
are reserved for seniors theses, reservered for freshmen, take place 
at Duke's marine lab, or do not have location listed, 

Additionally, we are creating a distance data frame which describes the distance
between building. For convenience, buildings that are close to each other are 
grouped together. For grouping building together, we have found a facebook post
that has already grouped buildings together based on proximity. However, we have
updated the grouping based on the most recent Duke map. The distance data
comes from finding the individual distances from each group's midpoint. For 
instance, finding the distance from group 1 to group 3 was found by finding
the distance between the middle of group 1 and the middle of group 3.

### Weekly Plan of Attack

  - Our team is available to meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 10:30 AM  to 12:00 PM. 

  - Week 1 of project (week of Mon, Oct 18): Kate, Yihan, and Kartik contributed
  3 potential ideas each and we chose one that would be the most interested. We
  decided to build a R Shiny app similar to Dukehub.
  
  - Week 2 of project (week of Mon, Oct 25):
      + Kate: project proposal - motivation and goal; create basic R shiny app 
      with UI and server files. 
      + Yihan: project proposal - introduction and description of each dataset
      + Kartik: weekly plans
      
  - Week 3 of project (week of Mon, Nov 1): 
      + Kate: Request Course data from Registrar's office and cleans data 
      + Yihan: Finish proposal and organize repo
      + Kartik: Finish proposal and creating datasets
  
  - Week 4 of project (week of Mon, Nov 8): Conduct peer review on project proposals,
  and optionally, submit in an updated version of your proposal.
      + All members: discuss peeer review; make any necessary modifications. 
      + Kate: Course builder tab 
      + Yihan: Class information tab 
      + Kartik: Weekly Calendar tab 

  - Week 5 of project (week of Mon, Nov 15): Continue working on the project,
  identify issues and consult TA/professor
      + Kate: Distance tab 
      + Yihan: Reccomendations tab
      + Kartik: Distance tab and reccomendations tab 

  - Week 6 of project (week of Mon, Nov 22): Continue working on the project.
      + Kate: End user testing: scheudule builder tab and distance tab. 
      + Yihan: End user testing: class information tab, recommendation
      + Kartik: End user testing: recommendations tab, distance tab
  
  - Week 7 of project (week of Mon, Nov 29): Conduct another round of peer review.
    + Make any adjustments based on peer review or end user testing. 
    + Kate: UI enhancements to schedule builder tab and distance tab. 
    + Yihan: UI enhancements to class information tab, recommendation
    + Kartik: UI enhancements to recommendations tab, distance tab,
    
  - Week 8 of Project(Due Date): Present our project
    + All team members: practice presentation leading up to final presentation
